            Hey there! Nice to see you again ðŸ˜Š I hold a Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science from the University of Victoria as well as a
            diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with tools like
            Blender or Photoshop, reading a book, playing video games ðŸŽ®
            (current hyperfixation being Hogwarts Legacy), or rewatching
            Coraline. You might also catch me doing something more tactile like
            building miniature sets or crocheting. If you're up for a chat about
            tech, have any recommendations for books, games, or movies, or just
            want to talk about anything creative, feel free to reach out!
