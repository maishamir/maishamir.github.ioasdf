            <p>
              Hey there! Nice to see you again ðŸ˜Š I hold a Bachelor's degree in
              Computer Science from the University of Victoria as well as a
              diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with tools like
              Blender or Photoshop, reading a book, playing video games ðŸŽ®
              (current hyperfixation being <span className="magic">Hogwarts Legacy</span>), or rewatching
              Coraline. You might also catch me doing something more tactile
              like building miniature sets or crocheting. If you're up for a
              chat about tech, have any recommendations for books, games, or
              movies, or just want to talk about anything creative, feel free to
              reach out!
            </p>
